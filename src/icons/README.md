# HireHack Icons

## Icon Requirements

The extension needs icons in multiple sizes:

- icon16.png (16x16) - Toolbar icon
- icon48.png (48x48) - Extension management page
- icon128.png (128x128) - Chrome Web Store

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can:

1. Create simple PNG icons using any image editor
2. Use online icon generators
3. Use placeholder icons from icon libraries

## Design Guidelines

- Use LinkedIn's blue color (#0077b5) as primary
- Include a distinctive "H" or briefcase symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

## Icon Locations

All icons should be placed in the `src/icons/` directory and will be copied to
the build output by webpack.
